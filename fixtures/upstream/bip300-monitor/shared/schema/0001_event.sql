-- `envelope` is the monitor's normalized protobuf and the source of truth for

-- exists only so the record can be queried.

-- One observation of one kind, for one slot, at one block. This is what makes
-- the snapshot republished on restart and the blocks replayed by a backfill
-- idempotent rather than duplicated.
--
-- A named constraint rather than a bare unique index, because the writer names
-- it in ON CONFLICT: an unnamed index would let a schema change silently move
-- the conflict target.
--
-- As written below this holds only for the kinds that carry a slot: Postgres
-- treats NULLs in a unique constraint as distinct, so the slot-less kinds never
-- conflicted. `0002_event_identity_nulls.sql` is what makes the claim above
-- true. This file is left as it was applied.
